# 1 - perceptron learning algorithm
This implementation is included in "perceptron.py" file.

#2 - synchronous Hopfield network
This implementation is included in "hopfield.py" file.

#3 - backpropagation algorithm
This implementation is included in "backpropagation.py" file.

"exceptions.py" file includes exception classes used in those algorithms.
"enums.py" file includes enum classes used in those algorithms.

"main.py" file contains main function, in which all algorihtm methods are used.  
To run this projec "numpy" and "matplotlib.pyplot" libraries are needed.
